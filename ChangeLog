2015/07/31: release libxcam version 0.2.1
 * improved OCL pipeline on basic 3a image processing
    - merged bayer kernels with blc, wb, gamma, demosaic and 3a stats.
    - merged yuv kernerls with rgb2yuv color conversion and macc.
    - support async framework as option on cl features
    - support OCL buffer allocation which can choose tiling mode.
 * support different AIQ versions.
 * fix capture of dead-loop and sensor format setting.

2015/07/02: release libxcam version 0.2.0
 * add gstreamer plugin 'xcamsrc' for Linux media framework support
 * support loading user-defined 3a algorithm lib dynamically
 * support more manual 3a features on ISP, e.g multiple-ae-window, ae/awb speed...
 * add OpenCL pipeline for 3a image processing
   - bayer format features, black level correction, defect pixel
     correction, whitebalance, 3a statistics calculation,
     demosaic, gamma correction, HDR(high dynamic range)
   - RGBA format features, bilateral NR(noise reduction), simple NR,
     temporal NR, macc, color correction
   - YUV format features,  temporal NR, edge enhancement, color conversion
   - support any user-defined 3a algorithms(e.g AIQ)
 * rich test cases, e.g. test-device-manager, test-cl-image
