2016/03/28: release libxcam version 0.5.0
 * enable new WDR tone mapping based on histogram adjustment.
    - apply bidirectional log based function on luminance to improve
      image contrast.
    - transmit wide dynamic range image data to 8-bit color data by
      novel histogram adjustment algorithm.
    - details in both over-exposured and under-exposured area clearly
      show up on screen.
 * enable wavelet-based algorithm for noise reduction.
    - decompose image into multiple-scales by wavelet transform with
      low pass and high pass filters.
    - perform soft threshold on smaller coefficients(high-pass)
      to reduce noise.
    - threshold should be suitably decided by tuned parameters.
    - reconstruct image from scaled low-pass and high-pass images.
    - enable Haar-wavelet and Hat-wavelet NR filters.
 * enable fog removal feature based on retinex algorithm.
    - base on retinex single-scale algorithm.
    - scale down image for gaussian blur to improve performance.
    - scale up blured image and amplify log differences with original
      image.
 * improve sharpness in normal light with extreme profile.
 * support cl post processing with isp mode.
 * support swap-buffer on nv12 format if only single plane need to
   process.

2015/12/30: release libxcam version 0.4.0
 * improve performance on OCL pipeline.
    - design new formats and pipeline to save memory IO.
    - improve bayer noise reduction with bilateral filter.
    - support edge enhancement into bayer pipe.
    - make gpu/cpu working together for 3a-statistics calculation.
    - move tonemapping kernel from RBG to bayer format.
 * improve WDR-tonemapping algorithm for quality.
    - utilize an new adaptive local tone mapping algorithm.
    - provide the mapping between 16-bit wide dynamic range images to
      8-bit images to have “nice looking”.
    - preserve more information on luminance values of the scene
      especially for high contrast images.
 * tonemapping parameters calculated to increase the contrast between
   high light and low light.
    - tone mapping regularization parameters are calculated according
      to the distribution of brightness histogram.
    - the local adaptive parameter are calculated by weighting the
      neighbor pixels with a Gaussian blur filter.
 * add bayer raw video input to simulate camera sensor.
