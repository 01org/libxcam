Description:
libXCam is a project for extended camera features, especially 3A process.
It separates 3A algorithm and image processors, and makes user defined
algorithm possible. This framework also makes GPU/CPU/ISP joining the image
process.

Features:
  * Image processing features.
    - 3A features
       Auto whitebalance, auto exposure, auto focus, black level correction,
       color correction, 3a-statistics calculation.
    - Basic features
       Gamma correction, MACC, color space, demosaicing, noise reduction,
       edge enhancement.
    - Advanced features
       - Noise reduction: simple bilateral NR, temporal NR, wavelet NR
       - WDR: gaussian-based tone-mapping, histogram adjustment tone-mapping
       - Fog removal: retinex algorithm.
  * Capture features support memory type of mmap and dma buffer.
  * Support 3rd party 3A lib which can be loaded dynamically.
  * Image processing based on both ISP and Open CL.
  * Support 3a analysis tuning framework for different features
  * Support smart analysis framework
  * Support as gstreamer plugin <xcamsrc>
